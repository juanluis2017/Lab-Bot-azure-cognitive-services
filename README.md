# BigBotTheory - Bot Framework - Hands On Lab
## Create your first bot with Microsoft Botframework
Welcome to the Bot Framework Hands On Lab!

The objective of this Hands On Lab is learning the basics of Bot Framework to help you create your own bot.

We are going to create a SheldonBot, a bot capable of:
- Talking to you about his friends.
- Recommending you a plan depending on the day of the week.
- Recognizing face emotions.
- Describing an image.

The lab has been divided in modules that cover up different areas of __Bot Framework__ and __Cognitives Services__.

- [Module 0](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-0): Prerequisites to complete this lab.
- [Module 1](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-1): Create your first bot.
- [Module 2](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-2): Publish your bot in Azure, register it in Bot Framework and connect it to different channels.
- [Module 3](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-3): Add dialogs to your bot.
- [Module 4](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-4): Add intelligence to your dialogs with LUIS.
- [Module 5](https://github.com/DanyStinson/BigBotTheory/tree/master/Modules/Module-5): Add Cognitive Services to your bot so it can describe pictures and recognize emotions. 

It is recommended you do start the lab from the beginning as we will add new features to the initial bot in each module.

If you want to start a module before doing the previous ones, there is a __Start__ folder in each module, that contains the solution created up to that module. You also have a __Finish__ folder containing complete solution of the module.
